            <h2>About Barter System</h2>
            <p>The barter system is a method of exchange where goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money. It is an ancient practice that has been used for centuries and is still used in some societies today.</p>
            <p>In a barter system, individuals negotiate the value of their goods or services and agree on a trade. This system relies on a double coincidence of wants, where each party must have something that the other party desires.</p>
